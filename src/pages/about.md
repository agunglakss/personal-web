Hi folks, I am <strong>Agung Laksono</strong>, a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> from Indonesia with <strong>4 years</strong> of experience.
I started my professional career in <strong>2014</strong>, which means it's been almost <strong>10 years</strong>!

<strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> is my main weapon right now, however, I also open to using other weapons if needed.
My weapons consist of PHP (Laravel & CI), NodeJS, ReactJS, GraphQL, PostgreSQL/MySQL, Linux OS, TypeScript/Javascript, HTML/CSS, GO.

I also have knowledge of <strong>DevOps</strong> such as CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes as well as setting up VPS to deploy an application.
